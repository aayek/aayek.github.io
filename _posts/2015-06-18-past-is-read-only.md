One day (not too far from today) a friend of mine said that "Past is Read Only".
WTF????
Yeah, it's true...you can see it, you can touch it, you can write or draw something on it like a
photograph, but you can't change it.
This is a simple concept...you can "__See the past__".
Let's do an example: the light that come from the moon spend just more than one second to come here,
so when you look at the moon, you actually see how it was just about one second ago.
So, imagine to expand this scenario: the light that come from the stars can spend thousand of years
to come to us, so, if we could see __THAT__ star now, actually we would see how it was thousand of years
ago...it seems like a good film..you can appreciate, comment it...you can create alternatives
(happy) endings, but the true is that is read only, just like the past.
