What I do
---------

I'm currently employed by a large Telco company, where I work as a Cloud System Engineer focusing on
Openstack Infrastructures.
I started out as a Linux System Engineer on the Ops Eng team, responsible for the infrastructure and 
architecture of our systems, as well as maintenance and support of production and non-production 
environments. My areas of specialization included automation and containerization, but I started my 
professional career as a Dev, so I'm also active as a in many open source projects.



A bit about me
--------------

I am an engineer based on Italy.
I come from Sicily, land of good hopes, good food, good people.
I love travel and spend my free time with my family...and today, the biggest and
difficult challenge of my life is to be a good father.  
...And what else? I'm Open Source enthusiast, I like to follow the last news about the main open 
source projects.
Passionate philosophy student, I enjoy reading and discovering new states of mind related to the
thought of ancient philosophers.
