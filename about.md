##What I do

I'm currently employed by a large Telco company, where I work as a System Engineer.  
I started out as a Linux System Engineer on the Operations Engineering team, responsible for the
infrastructure and architecture of our systems, as well as maintenance and support of production
and non-production environments. My areas of specialization included automation, Puppet,
and monitoring (specifically Nagios, Graphite, statsd, and Diamond), but I'm also active as a 
software developer in many open source projects.



##A bit about me

I am an engineer based on Italy.
I come from Sicily, land of good hopes, good food, good people.
Graduated from the [UniCT](https://www.dieei.unict.it), due to job reasons I moved to Turin, 
where I live with my two loves of my life.  
I love travel and spend my free time with my family...and today, the biggest and
difficult challenge of my life is to be a good father.  
...And what else? Oh, I'm Open Source enthusiast, I like to follow the last news about the main open 
source projects.  
Passionate philosophy student, I enjoy reading and discovering new states of mind related to the
thought of ancient philosophers.
